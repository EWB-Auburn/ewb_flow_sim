TODO List for dev branch
     Created: 2018-12-22
 Last update: 2018-12-22
========================
### Incomplete ###
Fully integrate hose minor head loss
Calculate head losses at PRV
More verbose results reporting (CSV/JSON/XML?)
Add structure def for lower tank

### Completed ###
Break sprinkler curve fit into own file
Break structure definition into own file
Getter for arbitrary link/node (useful for debug)

### Â¿Ideas? ###

Integrate hose head loss as links algorithmically added to structure instead of putting them in manually


### Problems Found ###
Incorrect R2 computation in square root curve fit. Minor effect.
Incorrect implementation of hosepipe head losses. Major effect.
